# Advanced-Kinematic-Analysis-for-Higgs-Boson-Signal-Background-Discrimination
Developing a Deep Neural Network with TensorFlow/Keras to classify Higgs boson signals in CERN data. The project features advanced feature engineering and progressive model optimization to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in discriminating signal from background noise.
